### Master and Capstone projects and desk studies for TCD students
If you are a student at TCD and are interested in doing a project in the PSF group, please drop me an email. 
I submit project titles when a call goes out but I also am happy to support interesting ideas in the general areas of plant biology (particularly belowground!), sustainability and data and technology applications to both.
