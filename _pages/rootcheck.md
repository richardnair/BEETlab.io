# RootCheck

In RootCheck we are building tools to improve root health assessment in agricultural systems. 
Roots are essential for sustainable and productive agriculture but in-field assesment lags well behind above-ground parts of plants. 
We are taking a stakeholder-focused approach to deliver a solution in via approachable technology so it can be used in future food system by everyday users. 
RootCheck is led by Richard, with collaborators Saoirse Tracy (UCD), Aoife Gowan (UCD) and Gillian Young (AFBI Newgrange),
RootCheck is funded via the SFI National Challenge Fund Future Food Systems call.
